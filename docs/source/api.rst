Re-run a Campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To re-run a campaign you need to provide the campaign id in the same URL with âstatusâ in the data. Specific actions inside the campaign specified by the status can also be re-started by entering the following input format.

Valid options are :literal:`hungup`, :literal:`unanswered`, :literal:`failed`, :literal:`terminated` and :literal:`completed`

Sample input to re-run a campaign based on the status:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "message": "Here you send your message you want to convey",
	"status": ["failed, hungup"]
   }

This will start the campaign for all numbers whose status is failed and hungup.

Note: If you are re-running a campaign that has Message and Audio input set, you need to set :literal:`priority` to indicate use of either :literal:`message` or :literal:`audio`. However, if you want to use new message or audio, you can supply it without priority with the attribute :literal:`message` or :literal:`audio` respectively.

Sample input encompassing all attributes:

.. code-block:: json

   {
	"priority": "audio",
	"voice_input": "np_prasanna",
	"schedule_date": "2023-05-09T17:07",
	"status": ["failed","hungup"]
   }

Sample Output:

.. code-block:: json
	
	{
		"status": 200,
    		"success": true,
    		"message": "Campaign is running",
    		"errors": [],
    		"data": {
			"hold amount": "3 credit on hold for sample campaign name campaign." 
        		}
    	}

OTP 
----

Send OTP Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - URL
     - Required Values
     - Other Values
     - HTTP Methods
   * - https://iris.techrida.com/api/system/send/otp/
     - number, message, sms_send_options
     - otp_length, otp_options
     - POST
     
By utilizing this endpoint, you can send OTPs to users by specifying the recipient's phone number as a string, along with the message containing the OTP and the desired delivery method - either through :literal:`voice` or :literal:`text` through the sms_send_option attribute. The OTP can be integrated in the message by passing it inside curly braces of the messages attribute.

For Example,

.. code-block:: json

   {
	"message" : "Hi Your OTP is {otp}"
   }

In addition, you have the flexibility to choose between sending your own OTP or generating it automatically through the OTP options attribute. The available options are :literal:`personnel` and :literal:`generated`. If you choose :literal:`personnel`, you'll need to provide the OTP yourself. On the other hand, if you select :literal:`generated`, the OTP will be auto-generated. In the :literal:`generated` scenario, you can specify the length  via the :literal:`otp_length` for the auto-generated OTP. If nothing is provided, by default a generated OTP will be provided.

Sample Input For Customized OTP

.. code-block:: json

   {
	"number": "9851023212",
	"message": "Hi your OTP is {otp}",
	"sms_send_options": "text",
	"otp_options": "personnel",
	"otp": "12345"
   }

Sample Input For Auto-Generated OTP

	"number": "9851023212",
	"message": "Hi your OTP is {otp}",
	"sms_send_options": "voice",
	"otp_options": "generated",
	"otp_length": "4"
   }
