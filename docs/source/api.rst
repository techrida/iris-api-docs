OTP 
----

Send OTP Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 25 25 25
   :header-rows: 1

   * - URL
     - Required Values
     - Other Values
     - HTTP Methods
   * - https://iris.techrida.com/api/system/send/otp/
     - number, message, sms_send_options
     - otp_length, otp_options
     - POST
     
By utilizing this endpoint, you can send OTPs to users by specifying the recipient's phone number as a string, along with the message containing the OTP and the desired delivery method - either through :literal:`voice` or :literal:`text` through the sms_send_option attribute. The OTP can be integrated in the message by passing it inside curly braces of the messages attribute.

For Example,

.. code-block:: json

   {
	"message" : "Hi Your OTP is {otp}"
   }

In addition, you have the flexibility to choose between sending your own OTP or generating it automatically through the OTP options attribute. The available options are :literal:`personnel` and :literal:`generated`. If you choose :literal:`personnel`, you'll need to provide the OTP yourself. On the other hand, if you select :literal:`generated`, the OTP will be auto-generated. In the :literal:`generated` scenario, you can specify the length  via the :literal:`otp_length` for the auto-generated OTP. If nothing is provided, by default a generated OTP will be provided.

Sample Input For Customized OTP

.. code-block:: json

   {
	"number": "9851023212",
	"message": "Hi your OTP is {otp}",
	"sms_send_options": "text",
	"otp_options": "personnel",
	"otp": "12345"
   }

Sample Input For Auto-Generated OTP


.. code-block:: json

   {
	"number": "9851023212",
	"message": "Hi your OTP is {otp}",
	"sms_send_options": "voice",
	"otp_options": "generated",
	"otp_length": "4"
   }


The details of the sent OTP is shown. 

Sample Output:

.. code-block:: json

   {
	"status": 200,
	    "success": true,
	    "message": "OTP Sent Successfully.",
	    "errors": [],
